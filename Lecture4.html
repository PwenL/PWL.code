    <dt style="color:Orange;">Color</dt>
    <dd style="color:Sienna;">- The background color of each sections would contradict each other.</dd>
    <dd style="color:Sienna;">- For example, colors such as yellow, blue, rad, purple would make up the most part of the visual plane for views.</dd>
    <dd style="color:Sienna;">- One noteworthy aspect would be how the first two parts changed their colors!</dd>
    <dt style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Shape</dt>
    <dd style="color:Salmon;">- Many different shapes were both in the images and outside the images. </dd>
    <dd style="color:Salmon;">- For example,there was an oval on the first section, and rectangles in a variety of sizes were in the later sections. </dd>

<em><ul style="color:SlateBlue;">
    <li>The format of titles for different sections, paragraphs, and their fonts were in repetition</li>
    <li>The four blocks with pairs being side by side of each other were also repeating.</li>
    <li>This repetition in the format of this web page allowed it to look well-organized, simple, and calm.</li>

<em><ul style="list-style-type:square; color:MidnightBlue;">
    <li>The initial part of blocks in this website was aligned diagonally, which means a larger block would had a larger block at its diagonal position. The second part of the blocks was organized with three in a line.</li>
    <li>The second part of the blocks was organized with three in a line.</li>
    <li>One can see the covers of the videos were aligned.</li>
    <li>Also, the categories, the titles, and the play button were organized and aligned.</li>

<a href="https://overflow.io/">Overflow</a>
<em><ol style="color:Teal;">
    <li>Proximity was presented really well in this web page because of its white spaces it had throughout the entire home page.</li>
    <li>There were spaces both around and in between parts of each section in which created a really nice visual art. </li>
    <li>Additionally, the variety of font sizes construct visual hierarchy for its content.</li>
    <li>Sights of viewers would be caught by the larger font following by the buttons with all uppercase letters, and at last, the smallest fonts.</li>
